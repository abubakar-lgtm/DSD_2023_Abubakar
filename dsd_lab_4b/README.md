## Overview
This repository contains the files and documentation for **Lab 4 part b**. The project includes RTL designs, testbench, constraints, and supporting documentation.

## Repository Structure
```
lab_4/
│-- rtl/          # Contains RTL (Register Transfer Level) design files
│-- testbench/    # Includes testbench files for verification
│-- docs/         # Documentation (e.g., Draw.io diagrams, design specs)
│-- constraints/  # Constraints files for synthesis and implementation
│-- README.md     # Project documentation
```

## Description
- **RTL**: This folder contains the hardware description language (HDL) files used to implement the design.
- **Testbench**: This folder includes testbench files to simulate and verify the functionality of the RTL design.
- **Docs**: Contains diagrams and other relevant documentation related to the project.
- **Constraints**: Stores constraint files needed for synthesis and implementation, such as timing and pin mappings.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lab_4.git
   cd lab_4
   ```
2. Open the RTL files in your preferred HDL editor (Vivado).
3. Run simulations using the testbench to verify functionality.
4. Check constraints before synthesis.

## Tools Used
- **HDL**: SystemVerilog 
- **Simulation**:  QuestaSim / Xilinx Vivado
- **Synthesis**: Xilinx Vivado 
- **Documentation**: Draw.io
